There were a few fish images classified as 'NoF' but drastically reduced from the earlier epochs.

Model fails to predict 'NoF' except in the very certain cases due to the penalty for missing the low frequency fish examples (Thus if it doesn't know it is guessing fish).  In the TEST images, often a fish is predicted when a fish is present, however it is rarely the correct fish.  Nevertheless, this shows progress. Current training time stands at 3d 20 hours... and my laptop needs a rest.  "
